# Ros2 Turtle Catcher
**Hector Cornejo Morales**
**Augusto Mantilla Molina**

> Activity: The objective of this assignment is to design a reactive control system in ROS2 using the turtlesim simulator.

---

**The sistem consist of**  
- A spawner node that continuously creates turtles and publishes their information.
- A controller node that:
    - Monitors the position of **turtle1**
    - Receives a list of alive turtles
    - Computes which turtle is the closest
    - Moves **turtle1** toward the nearest turtle
    - Calls a service to remove (catch) the turtle when it reaches it  
The controller implements a proportional control strategy to guide turtle1 toward the nearest target at all times.

## 1) Turtle Controller 
## Controller Implementation
### Libraries
``` code
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
from turtlesim.msg import Pose
import math
import numpy as np
from turtle_catcher_interfaces.msg import TurtleArray
from turtle_catcher_interfaces.srv import CatchTurtle 
```  
**What does it do?**  
- **rclpy** → ROS2 Python client library 
- **Node** → Base class for creating ROS2 nodes
- **Twist** → Message used to control turtle velocity
- **Pose** → Message that provides turtle position and orientation
- **math** and **numpy** → Used for geometric calculations
- **TurtleArray** → Custom message that contains all alive turtles
- **CatchTurtle** → Custom service used to remove a turtle

---

### Class Definition and Constructor
``` code
class Turtle_Controller(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('turtle_controller')

        self.cmd_publisher = self.create_publisher(Twist, "turtle1/cmd_vel", 10)
        self.pose_sub = self.create_subscription(Pose, "turtle1/pose", self.pose_callback, 10)
        self.alive_sub = self.create_subscription(TurtleArray, "alive_turtles", self.alive_turtles_callback, 10)

        self.catch_client = self.create_client(CatchTurtle, "catch_turtle")

        while not self.catch_client.wait_for_service(timeout_sec=1.0):
            self.get_logger().info("Waiting for catch_turtle service...")

        self.timer = self.create_timer(0.01, self.control_loop)

        self.current_pose = None
        self.target_turtle = []

        self.Kp_d = 1.5
        self.Kp_theta = 6.0

        self.get_logger().info("Your Turtlesim Controller is operational")
```

**What does it do?**  
- Initializes the node with the name **turtle_controller** 
- **Creates**
    - A publisher to control **turtle1**
    - A subscriber to read the pose of **turtle1**
    - A subscriber to receive all alive turtles
- Creates a service client to request turtle removal
- Waits until the **catch_turtle** service is available
- Creates a timer that executes the control loop every 0.01 seconds
- Defines proportional gains for:
 - Distance control (Kp_d)
 - Orientation control (Kp_theta)

---

### Pose Callback
``` code
def pose_callback(self, msg):
    self.current_pose = msg
```  
**What does it do?**  
- Stores the current position and orientation of **turtle1** 
- This data is later used for distance and angle calculations 

---

### Alive Turtle Callback
``` code
def alive_turtles_callback(self, msg):
    self.target_turtle = msg.turtles
```  
**What does it do?**  
- Receives the list of currently alive turtles
- Stores them in **self.target_turtle**
- This list is used to determine which turtle is closest

---

### Control Loop
``` code
def control_loop(self):

    if self.current_pose is None or len(self.target_turtle) == 0:
        return

    min_distance = float('inf')
    nearest_turtle = None

    for turtle in self.target_turtle:
        dx = turtle.x - self.current_pose.x
        dy = turtle.y - self.current_pose.y
        distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
        if distance < min_distance:
            min_distance = distance
            nearest_turtle = turtle

    if nearest_turtle is None:
        return

    dx = nearest_turtle.x - self.current_pose.x
    dy = nearest_turtle.y - self.current_pose.y

    distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)

    theta_target = math.atan2(dy, dx)
    angle_error = theta_target - self.current_pose.theta
    angle_error = (angle_error + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi

    cmd = Twist()

    if distance < 0.3:

        request = CatchTurtle.Request()
        request.name = nearest_turtle.name
        self.catch_client.call_async(request)

        self.get_logger().info(f"Capturando {nearest_turtle.name}")

        cmd.linear.x = 0.0
        cmd.angular.z = 0.0

    else:
        cmd.linear.x = self.Kp_d * distance
        cmd.angular.z = self.Kp_theta * angle_error

    self.cmd_publisher.publish(cmd)
```  
**What does it do?**  
- Verifies that pose and turtle data are available.  
- Computes the distance to each turtle. 
- Selects the turtle with the smallest distance.  
- Calculates:
    - Distance to the target
    - Desired heading angle
    - Angular error
- Applies proportional control to generate velocity commands.
- If the turtle is close enough (distance < 0.3):
    - Calls the service to remove it.
    - Stops movement.

---

### Control Operation
The controller uses a Proportional (P) **control strategy** to make a proportional control for the linear and angular velocitys.  
The angle error is normalized between −π and 𝜋 to ensure smooth rotation.
This creates a reactive pursuit behavior where **turtle1** always moves toward the nearest turtle.
